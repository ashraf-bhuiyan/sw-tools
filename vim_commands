#indentatin
Use the > command. To indent 5 lines, 5>>. I also setup the .vimrc to set tab as 1 space. Good for python indentation. 
To indent a curly-braces block, put your cursor on one of the curly braces and use >%.

If youâ€™re copying blocks of text around and need to align the indent of a block in its new location, use ]p instead of just p. This aligns the pasted block with the surrounding text.

#when copy code from website to a vim c++ or bash file, then somtime // and # makes the indentation messed up. 
#The remedy is: run in the vim doc:
:set paste
Then paste the code. It will then not mess up the indentation.
